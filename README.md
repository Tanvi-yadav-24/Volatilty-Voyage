# Volatilty-Voyage
This repository contains the work done as part of Volatility Voyage, a project under the Finance &amp; Analytics Club, IIT Kanpur.

The project focuses on volatility modeling, trading strategies, and risk analysis using Python. It includes implementations of EMA-based trend strategies and ATR breakout strategies, along with a custom backtesting framework to evaluate performance using metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, drawdown, VaR, and CVaR.

The repository also covers portfolio optimization on Indian equities, including plotting the Efficient Frontier and identifying the Minimum Variance and Tangency portfolios.
For market risk analysis, volatility forecasting is performed on NIFTY 50 using methods like Rolling Mean, EWMA, and AR(1), with stock selection based on different risk profiles.

Additionally, the project explores time-series models such as ARMA, ARIMA, and GARCH, applies MLE and KS tests, and implements a basic long–short hedging strategy.

Overall, this repository documents hands-on learning in quantitative trading, risk management, and financial time-series analysis.
